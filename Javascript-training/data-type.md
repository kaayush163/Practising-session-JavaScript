## Is JS interpreted or compiled?

### In JavaScript, there are two main categories of data types: primitive and non-primitive.

Primitive data types include:

- Number: represents numeric values.
- String: represents textual data.
- Boolean: represents either true or false.
- Null: represents the intentional absence of any object value. (null)
- Undefined: represents the absence of a defined value. (undefined)
- Symbol: represents a unique identifier.

Non-primitive data types include:

- Object: represents a collection of key-value pairs.
- Array: represents an ordered list of values.

## Mutation

- An immutable value is one that, once created, can never be changed. Mutation is the change in the original code or data
- Primitive Data types are immutable while non-primitives are mutable.
